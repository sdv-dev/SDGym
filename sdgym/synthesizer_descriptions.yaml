    The TVAE Synthesizer uses a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based, neural network
    techniques to train a model and generate synthetic data.

CTGANSynthesizer:
  library: sdv
  modality: single_table
  type: Deep Learning
  description: >
    The CTGAN Synthesizer uses GAN-based, deep learning methods to train a model and generate synthetic data.

CopulaGANSynthesizer:
  library: sdv
  modality: single_table
  type: Deep Learning
  description: >
    The Copula GAN Synthesizer uses a mix classic, statistical methods and
    GAN-based deep learning methods to train a model and generate synthetic data.

GaussianCopulaSynthesizer:
  library: sdv
  modality: single_table
  type: Statistical
  description: >
    The Gaussian Copula Synthesizer uses classic, statistical methods to train a model and generate synthetic data.

RealTabFormerSynthesizer:
  library: realtabformer
  modality: single_table
  type: Deep Learning
  description: >
    Transformer-based deep learning synthesizer that treats tabular data as
    a sequence modeling problem, inspired by large language models.

HMASynthesizer:
  library: sdv
  modality: multi_table
  type: Hierarchical Modeling
  description: >
    The HMA Synthesizer uses hierarchical ML algorithm to learn from real data
    and generate synthetic data.  The algorithm uses classical statistics.

HSASynthesizer:
  library: sdv
  modality: multi_table
  type: Hierarchical Sampling
  description: >
    The HSA Synthesizer uses a segment-based algorithm to learn from your real data
    and generate synthetic data. This synthesizer offers fast performance for unlimited tables.

IndependentSynthesizer:
  library: sdv
  modality: multi_table
  type: Statistical
  description: >
    The Independent Synthesizer learns each table's patterns independently.
    This synthesizer offers fast performance for unlimited tables.

UniformSynthesizer:
  library: sdgym
  modality: single_table
  type: Statistical
  description: >
    Statistical baseline synthesizer that generates values uniformly at random
    within the observed bounds of each column.

MultiTableUniformSynthesizer:
  library: sdgym
  modality: multi_table
  type: Statistical
  description: >
    Multi-table baseline synthesizer that generates data uniformly at random
    for each table while preserving table schemas.

ColumnSynthesizer:
  library: sdgym
  modality: single_table
  type: Statistical
  description: >
    Lightweight statistical synthesizer that applies simple, column-wise models
    without learning inter-column dependencies.

DataIdentity:
  library: sdgym
  modality: single_table
  type: Data-copying
  description: >
    Degenerate synthesizer that returns the original training data unchanged,
    primarily useful for debugging and benchmarking.
