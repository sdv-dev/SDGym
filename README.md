# Overview

Synthetic Data Gym (SDGym) is a framework to benchmark the performance of synthetic data generators
for tabular data. SDGym is a project of the [Data to AI Laboratory](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/) at MIT.

## What is a Synthetic Data Generator?

A **Synthetic Data Generator** is a Python function (or class method) that takes as input some
data, which we call the *real* data, learns a model from it, and outputs new *synthetic* data that
has similar mathematical properties as the *real* one.

Please refer to the [synthesizers documentation](SYNTHESIZERS.md) for instructions about how to
implement your own Synthetic Data Generator and integrate with SDGym. You can also read about how
to use the ones included in **SDGym** and see the current [leaderboard](SYNTHESIZERS.md#leaderboard).

## Benchmark datasets

**SDGym** evaluates the performance of **Synthetic Data Generators** using datasets
that are in three families:

* Simulated data generated using Gaussian Mixtures
* Simulated data generated using Bayesian Networks
* Real world datasets

Further details about how these datasets were generated can be found in the [Modeling Tabular
data using Conditional GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00503) paper and in the [datasets
documentation](DATASETS.md).

## Current Leaderboard

This is a summary of the current SDGym leaderboard, showing the number of datasets in which
each Synthesizer obtained the best score.

The complete scores table can be found in the [synthesizers document](SYNTHESIZERS.md#leaderboard)
and it can also be downloaded as a CSV file form here: [sdgym/leaderboard.csv](sdgym/leaderboard.csv)

Detailed leaderboard results for all the releases are available [in this Google Docs Spreadsheet](
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iNJDVG_tIobcsGUG5Gn4iLa565vVhz2U/edit).

# Install

## Requirements

**SDGym** has been developed and tested on [Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Also, although it is not strictly required, the usage of a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
is highly recommended in order to avoid interfering with other software installed in the system
where **SDGym** is run.

## Install with pip

The easiest and recommended way to install **SDGym** is using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install sdgym
```

This will pull and install the latest stable release from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/).

If you want to install it from source or contribute to the project please read the
[Contributing Guide](https://sdv-dev.github.io/SDGym/contributing.html#get-started) for
more details about how to do it.

# Usage

## Benchmarking your own synthesizer

All you need to do in order to use the SDGym Benchmark, is to import `sdgym` and call its
`run` function passing it your synthesizer function and the settings that you want to use
for the evaluation.

For example, if we want to evaluate a simple synthesizer function in the `adult` dataset
we can execute:

```python3
import numpy as np
import sdgym

def my_synthesizer_function(real_data, categorical_columns, ordinal_columns):
    """dummy synthesizer that just returns a permutation of the real data."""
    return np.random.permutation(real_data)

scores = sdgym.run(synthesizers=my_synthesizer_function, datasets=['adult'])
```

* You can learn how to create your own synthesizer function [here](SYNTHESIZERS.md).
* You can learn about different arguments for `sdgym.run` function [here](BENCHMARK.md).

The output of the `sdgym.run` function will be a `pd.DataFrame` containing the results obtained
by your synthesizer on each dataset, as well as the results obtained previously by the SDGym
synthesizers:

```
                        adult/accuracy  adult/f1  ...  ring/test_likelihood
IndependentSynthesizer         0.56530  0.134593  ...             -1.958888
UniformSynthesizer             0.39695  0.273753  ...             -2.519416
IdentitySynthesizer            0.82440  0.659250  ...             -1.705487
...                                ...       ...  ...                   ...
my_synthesizer_function        0.64865  0.210103  ...             -1.964966
```

## Benchmarking the SDGym Synthesizers

If you want to run the SDGym benchmark on the SDGym Synthesizers you can directly pass the
corresponding class, or a list of classes, to the `sdgym.run` function.

For example, if you want to run the complete benchmark suite to evaluate all the existing
synthesizers you can run (this will take a lot of time to run!):

```python
from sdgym.synthesizers import (
    CLBNSynthesizer, CTGANSynthesizer, IdentitySynthesizer, IndependentSynthesizer,
    MedganSynthesizer, PrivBNSynthesizer, TableganSynthesizer, TVAESynthesizer,
    UniformSynthesizer, VEEGANSynthesizer)

all_synthesizers = [
    CLBNSynthesizer,
    IdentitySynthesizer,
    IndependentSynthesizer,
    MedganSynthesizer,
    PrivBNSynthesizer,
    TableganSynthesizer,
    CTGANSynthesizer,
    TVAESynthesizer,
    UniformSynthesizer,
    VEEGANSynthesizer,
]
scores = sdgym.run(synthesizers=all_synthesizers)
```

For further details about all the arguments and possibilities that the `benchmark` function offers
please refer to the [benchmark documentation](BENCHMARK.md)
