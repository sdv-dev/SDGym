# Overview

Synthetic Data Gym (SDGym) is a framework to benchmark the performance of synthetic data
generators based on [SDV](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV) and [SDMetrics](
https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics).

## What is a Synthetic Data Generator?

A **Synthetic Data Generator** is a Python function (or method) that takes as input some
data, which we call the *real* data, learns a model from it, and outputs new *synthetic* data that
has the same structure and similar mathematical properties as the *real* one.

Please refer to the [synthesizers documentation](SYNTHESIZERS.md) for instructions about how to
implement your own Synthetic Data Generator and integrate with SDGym. You can also read about how
to use the ones already included in **SDGym** and see how to run them.

## Benchmark datasets

**SDGym** evaluates the performance of **Synthetic Data Generators** using *single table*,
*multi table* and *timeseries* datasets stored as CSV files alongside an [SDV Metadata](
https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/relational/relational_metadata.html) JSON file.

Further details about the list of available datasets and how to add your own datasets to
the collection can be found in the [datasets documentation](DATASETS.md).

# Install

**SDGym** can be installed using the following commands:

**Using `pip`:**

```bash
pip install sdgym
```

**Using `conda`:**

```bash
conda install -c pytorch -c conda-forge sdgym
```

For more installation options please visit the [SDGym installation Guide](INSTALL.md)

# Usage

## Benchmarking your own Synthesizer

SDGym evaluates **Synthetic Data Generators**, which are Python functions (or classes) that take
as input some data, which we call the *real* data, learn a model from it, and output new
*synthetic* data that has the same structure and similar mathematical properties as the *real* one.

As an example, let use define a synthesizer function that applies the [GaussianCopula model from SDV
](https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/gaussian_copula.html) with `gaussian` distribution.

```python3
import numpy as np
from sdv.tabular import GaussianCopula


def create_gaussian_copula(real_data, metadata):
    gc = GaussianCopula(default_distribution='gaussian')
    table_name = metadata.get_tables()[0]
    gc.fit(real_data[table_name])
    num_rows = len(real_data[table_name])
    return (table_name, num_rows, gc)

def sample_gaussian_copula(synthesizer, num_samples):
    table_name, num_rows, gc = synthesizer
    return {table_name: gc.sample(num_rows)}
```

|:information_source: You can learn how to create your own synthesizer function [here](SYNTHESIZERS.md).|
|:-|

We can now try to evaluate this function on the `asia` and `alarm` datasets:

```python3
import sdgym

scores = sdgym.benchmark_single_table(
    synthesizers=(create_gaussian_copula, sample_gaussian_copula), sdv_datasets=['asia', 'alarm'])
```

|:information_source: You can learn about different arguments for `sdgym.run` function [here](BENCHMARK.md).|
|:-|

The output of the `sdgym.run` function will be a `pd.DataFrame` containing the results obtained
by your synthesizer on each dataset.

| synthesizer     | dataset | modality     | metric          |      score | metric_time | model_time |
|-----------------|---------|--------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| gaussian_copula | asia    | single-table | BNLogLikelihood |  -2.842690 |    2.762427 |   0.752364 |
| gaussian_copula | alarm   | single-table | BNLogLikelihood | -20.223178 |    7.009401 |   3.173832 |

## Benchmarking the SDGym Synthesizers

If you want to run the SDGym benchmark on the SDGym Synthesizers you can directly pass the
corresponding class, or a list of classes, to the `sdgym.run` function.

For example, if you want to run the complete benchmark suite to evaluate all the existing
synthesizers you can run (:warning: this will take a lot of time to run!):

```python
from sdgym.synthesizers import (
    CLBN, CopulaGAN, CTGAN, HMA1, Identity, Independent,
    MedGAN, PAR, PrivBN, SDV, TableGAN, TVAE,
    Uniform, VEEGAN)

all_synthesizers = [
    CLBN,
    CTGAN,
    CopulaGAN,
    HMA1,
    Identity,
    Independent,
    MedGAN,
    PAR,
    PrivBN,
    SDV,
    TVAE,
    TableGAN,
    Uniform,
    VEEGAN,
]
scores = sdgym.run(synthesizers=all_synthesizers)
```

For further details about all the arguments and possibilities that the `benchmark` function offers
please refer to the [benchmark documentation](BENCHMARK.md)

[The Synthetic Data Vault Project](https://sdv.dev) was first created at MIT's [Data to AI Lab](
https://dai.lids.mit.edu/) in 2016. After 4 years of research and traction with enterprise, we
created [DataCebo](https://datacebo.com) in 2020 with the goal of growing the project.
Today, DataCebo is the proud developer of SDV, the largest ecosystem for
synthetic data generation & evaluation. It is home to multiple libraries that support synthetic
data, including:

* ðŸ”„ Data discovery & transformation. Reverse the transforms to reproduce realistic data.
* ðŸ§  Multiple machine learning models -- ranging from Copulas to Deep Learning -- to create tabular,
  multi table and time series data.
* ðŸ“Š Measuring quality and privacy of synthetic data, and comparing different synthetic data
  generation models.

[Get started using the SDV package](https://sdv.dev/SDV/getting_started/install.html) -- a fully
integrated solution and your one-stop shop for synthetic data. Or, use the standalone libraries
for specific needs.
