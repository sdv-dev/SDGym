# Overview

Synthetic Data Gym (SDGym) is a framework to benchmark the performance of synthetic data generators
for non-temporal tabular data. SDGym is based on the paper [Modeling Tabular data using Conditional
GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00503), and the project is part of the [Data to AI
Laboratory](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/) at MIT.

The benchmarking of a synthesizer is a process in which different datasets are generated by your
synthesizer. Then, each couple of real and synthetic data is evaluated with multiple scores.

## What is a synthesizer function?

In order to use **SDGym** you will need a synthesizer function.
This is a function that takes as input a numpy matrix with real data and outputs another numpy
matrix with the same shape filled with synthesized data.

Also, alongside the real data, some additional variables informing about the column contents
will be passed, which means that the exact signature of the function will be like this:


```python
def my_synthesizer_function(
    real_data: numpy.ndarray,
    categorical_columns: list,
    ordinal_columns: list
) -> syntehtesized_data: numpy.ndarray
```

If your synthesizer implements a different interface, you can wrap it in a function like this:

```python
def my_synthesizer_function(real_data, categorical_columns, ordinal_columns):
    # ...do all necessary steps here...
    return synthesized_data
```

This function should contain inside it all the parameters and arguments needed to use your
synthesizer and call it to generate the new synthesized data based on the real data that is
being passed.

## What data should your synthesizer work with?

As we mentioned in the section before, the main input of **SDGym** is a synthesizer to be
benchmarked, which is expected to be a function that has as unique input and output a table of
data.

The inputs for your synthesizer funciton should be:

* `real_data`: a 2D `numpy.ndarray` with the real data the your synthesizer will attempt to imitate.
* `categorical_columns`: a `list` with the indexes of any columns that should be considered
  categorical independently on their type.
* `ordinal_columns`: a `list` with the indexes of any integer columns that should be treated as
  ordinal values.

And the output should be a single 2D `numpy.ndarray` with the exact same shape as the `real_data`
matrix.

## Benchmark datasets

All the datasets used for the benchmarking can be found inside the [sgdym S3 bucket](http://sdgym.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
in the form of an `.npz` numpy matrix archive and a `.json` metadata file that contains information
about the dataset structure and their columns.

In order to load these datasets in the same format as they will be passed to your synthesizer function
you can use the `sdgym.load_dataset` function passing the name of the dataset to load.

In this example, we will load the `adult` dataset:

```python
from sdgym import load_dataset

data, categorical_columns, ordinal_columns = load_dataset('adult')
```

This will return a numpy matrix with the data that will be passed to your synthesizer function,
as well as the list of indexes for the categorical and ordinal columns:

```python
>>> data
array([[2.70000e+01, 0.00000e+00, 1.77119e+05, ..., 4.40000e+01,
        0.00000e+00, 0.00000e+00],
       [2.70000e+01, 0.00000e+00, 2.16481e+05, ..., 4.00000e+01,
        0.00000e+00, 0.00000e+00],
       [2.50000e+01, 0.00000e+00, 2.56263e+05, ..., 4.00000e+01,
        0.00000e+00, 0.00000e+00],
       ...,
       [4.50000e+01, 0.00000e+00, 2.07540e+05, ..., 4.00000e+01,
        0.00000e+00, 1.00000e+00],
       [5.10000e+01, 0.00000e+00, 1.80807e+05, ..., 4.00000e+01,
        0.00000e+00, 0.00000e+00],
       [6.10000e+01, 4.00000e+00, 1.86451e+05, ..., 4.00000e+01,
        0.00000e+00, 1.00000e+00]], dtype=float32)
>>> categorical_columns
[1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14]
>>> ordinal_columns
[3]
```

## Demo Synthesizers

In order to get started using the benchmarking tool, some demo Synthesizers have been included
in the library.

These synthesizers are classes that can be imported from the `sdgym.synthesizers` module and have
the following methods:

* `fit`: Fits the synthesizer on the data. Expects the following arguments:
    * `data (numpy.ndarray)`: 2 dimensional Numpy matrix with the real data to learn from.
    * `categorical_columns (list or tuple)`: List of indexes of the columns that are categorical within the dataset.
    * `ordinal_columns (list or tuple)`: List of indexes of the columns that are ordinal within the dataset.
* `sample`: Generates new data resembling the original dataset. Expects the following arguments:
    * `n_samples (int)`: Number of samples to generate.
* `fit_sample`: Fits the synthesizer on the dataset and then samples as many rows as there were in
  the original dataset. It expects the same arguments as the `fit` method, and is ready to be directly
  passed to the `benchmark` function in order to evaluate the synthesizer performance.

A complete example about how to use them can be found below in the [Usage](#usage) section.

# Install

## Requirements

**SDGym** has been developed and tested on [Python 3.5, and 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Also, although it is not strictly required, the usage of a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
is highly recommended in order to avoid interfering with other software installed in the system
where **SDGym** is run.

These are the minimum commands needed to create a virtualenv using python3.6 for **SDGym**:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -p $(which python3.6) sdgym-venv
```

Afterwards, you have to execute this command to have the virtualenv activated:

```bash
source sdgym-venv/bin/activate
```

Remember about executing it every time you start a new console to work on **SDGym**!

## Install with pip

After creating the virtualenv and activating it, we recommend using
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) in order to install **SDGym**:

```bash
pip install sdgym
```

This will pull and install the latest stable release from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/).

## Install from source

Alternatively, with your virtualenv activated, you can clone the repository and install it from
source by running `make install` on the `stable` branch:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sdv-dev/SDGym.git
cd SDGym
git checkout stable
make install
```

## Install for Development

If you want to contribute to the project, a few more steps are required to make the project ready
for development.

First, please head to [the GitHub page of the project](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDGym)
and make a fork of the project under you own username by clicking on the **fork** button on the
upper right corner of the page.

Afterwards, clone your fork and create a branch from master with a descriptive name that includes
the number of the issue that you are going to work on:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:{your username}/SDGym.git
cd SDGym
git branch issue-xx-cool-new-feature master
git checkout issue-xx-cool-new-feature
```

Finally, install the project with the following command, which will install some additional
dependencies for code linting and testing.

```bash
make install-develop
```

Make sure to use them regularly while developing by running the commands `make lint` and
`make test`.

## Compile C++ dependencies

In order to be able to use all the features from SDGym, some dependencies written in C++ need to
be compiled.

In order to do this:

1. make sure to have installed all the necessary dependencies to compile C++. In Linux distributions
based on Ubuntu, this can be done with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

2. Execute:

```bash
make compile
```

# Usage

## Benchmark

All you need to do in order to use the SDGym Benchmark, is to import and call the `sdgym.benchmark`
function passing it your synthesizer function:

```python
from sdgym import benchmark

scores = benchmark(my_synthesizer_function)
```

The output of the `benchmark` function will be a `pd.DataFrame` containing all the scores
computed by the different evaluators:

```

3    0.8511  0.684467  MLPClassifier(activation='relu', alpha=0.0001,...       0.0   adult     2
```

## Using the Demo Synthesizers

In order to use the synthesizer classes included in **SDGym**, you need to follow these steps:

1. Import the synthesizer class from `sdgym.synthesizers`:

```python
from sdgym.synthesizers import IndependentSynthesizer
```

2. Create an instance of the synthesizers passing any needed arguments. In this case we will use
the `IndependentSynthesizer`, which can be instantiated with no initialization arguments:

```python
synthesizer = IndependentSynthesizer()
```

3. Load some data to fit your synthesizer with. In this case, we will be loading the `adult`
dataset:

```python
from sdgym import load_dataset

data, categorical_columns, ordinal_columns = load_dataset('adult')
```

3. Call its `fit` method passing the data as well as the lists of categorical and ordinal columns:

```python
synthesizer.fit(data, categorical_columns, ordinal_columns)
```

4. Call its `sample` method passing the number of rows that we want to sample:

```python
sampled = synthesizer.sample(3)
```

This will return a numpy matrix of sampeld data with the same columns as the original data and
as many rows as we have requested:

```
array([[5.1774925e+01, 0.0000000e+00, 5.3538445e+04, 6.0000000e+00,
        8.9999313e+00, 2.0000000e+00, 1.0000000e+00, 3.0000000e+00,
        2.0000000e+00, 1.0000000e+00, 3.7152294e-04, 1.9912617e-04,

       [6.5659584e+01, 5.0000000e+00, 3.6158912e+05, 8.0000000e+00,
        9.0010223e+00, 0.0000000e+00, 1.2000000e+01, 3.0000000e+00,
        0.0000000e+00, 0.0000000e+00, 1.0562389e-03, 0.0000000e+00,
        3.9998917e+01, 0.0000000e+00, 0.0000000e+00]], dtype=float32)
```

## Benchmarking the Demo Synthesizers

Evaluating the performance of any of the Demo synthesizers as as simple as:

1. Creaeting an instance of the synthesizer:

```python
synthesizer = IndependentSynthesizer()
```

2. Passing the `fit_sample` method of the instance to the `benchmark` function as your
synthesizer function:

```python
benchmark(synthesizer.fit_sample)
```
