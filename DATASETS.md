# SDGym Datasets

**SDGym** uses SDV datasets to benchmark the **Synthesizers** which are in three data modalities:

* Single Table Datasets: Datasets that contain only one table with no inter-row dependencies.
* Multi Table Datasets: Datasets that contain more than one table, potentially with relationships
  between them.
* Time Series Datasets: Datasets that contain a single table that represents sequences of rows.

## Dataset Format

The **SDV Datasets** are comprised of two elements:

* A `metadata.json` file which describes the data found in the dataset. This file follows the
  [SDV Metadata schema](https://sdv.dev/SDV/developer_guides/sdv/metadata.html)
* A collection of `CSV` files stored in a format which can be loaded by the `pandas.read_csv`
  function without any additional arguments than the csv path.

## Using the datasets

All the datasets can also be found for download inside the [sgdym S3 bucket](
http://sdgym.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) in the form of a `.zip` file that contains
both the `metadata.json` and the `CSV` file collection.

In order to load these datasets in the same format as they will be passed to your synthesizer
you can use the `sdgym.load_dataset` function passing the name of the dataset to load.

In this example, we will load the `adult` dataset:

```python3
In [1]: from sdgym.datasets import load_dataset

In [2]: metadata = load_dataset('adult')
```

This will read the `metadata.json` file and return it as a `sdv.Metadata` instance.

```python
In [3]: metadata
Out[3]:
Metadata
  root_path: /home/xals/.local/share/SDGym/datasets/adult
  tables: ['adult']
  relationships:
```

Afterwards, you can load the tables from the dataset passing the loaded `metadata` to the
`sdgym.load_tables` function:

```python3
In [4]: from sdgym.datasets import load_tables

In [5]: tables = load_tables(metadata)
```

This will return a `dict` containing the tables loaded as `pandas.DataFrames`.

```python3
In [6]: tables
Out[6]:

## Getting the list of all the datasets

If you want to obtain the list of all the available datasets you can use the
`sdgym.datasets.get_available_datasets` function:

```python
In [7]: from sdgym.datasets import get_available_datasets

In [8]: get_available_datasets()
Out[8]:
                          name      size
